# SlimeHUD

Adds a WAILA (What Am I Looking At) HUD for Slimefun items. Lets you see what Slimefun item a block is without breaking or opening its menu. Can be set to display in the bossbar or above the hotbar in `config.yml`. Individual players can also toggle their WAILA HUD with `/slimehud toggle`.

## Preview

## Limitations

- Minecraft only has 7 colors for the bossbar, compared to 16 for regular items.
- Does not work with hex color codes (defaults to white).

## Requirements

- Spigot or its derivatives
- Slimefun, of course
