# SlimeHUD

Adds a WAILA (What Am I Looking At) HUD for Slimefun items. Lets you see what Slimefun item a block is without breaking or opening its menu. Can be set to display in the bossbar or above the hotbar in `config.yml`. Additional energy/cargo information can also be toggled on or off in `config.yml`. Individual players can also toggle their WAILA HUD with `/slimehud toggle`.

- Does not work with hex color codes (defaults to white).

## Requirements

- Spigot or its derivatives
- Slimefun, of course
